### Analysis and Fixes for the `qpow` Function

The function `qpow` is intended to compute \(a^b \mod m\) using modular exponentiation. However, there are several issues in the current implementation that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Odd Exponents:**
   - The current code checks if the exponent `b` is odd by assigning `char odd = !is_odd(b);`. This logic is incorrect because it should be checking if `b` is odd, not even. It should be `char odd = is_odd(b);`.

2. **Handling Division by 2:**
   - The function `div2` divides the exponent `b` by 2, but it does not handle the case where `b` is odd correctly. When `b` is odd, the division should also subtract 1 from `b` before dividing.

3. **Multiplication and Modulo Operations:**
   - The multiplication and modulo operations should ensure that the result stays within the bounds of the modulus `m`. The current implementation of `mul` and `mod` functions needs to be checked for correctness.

4. **Initialization of Result:**
   - The initialization of the result `res` when the exponent `b` is 0 should be handled more carefully. The current code sets all elements of `res` to 0 except `res[0] = 1`, which is correct, but it should be done in a more concise manner.

5. **Recursive Call and Multiplication Order:**
   - The recursive call to `qpow` and subsequent multiplication should be ordered correctly to ensure the final result is accurate.

### Corrected Code

Here is the corrected version of the `qpow` function along with necessary changes in related functions:

```c
void qpow(Bighex a, Bighex b, Bighex m, Bighex res) {
    if (is_0(b)) {
        // Initialize res to 1
        for (int i = 0; i < LEN; ++i) res[i] = 0;
        res[0] = 1;
        return;
    }

    char odd = is_odd(b);  // Check if b is odd
    div2(b);               // Divide b by 2

    qpow(a, b, m, res);    // Recursive call

    mul(res, res);         // Square the result
    mod(res, m);           // Take modulo m

    if (odd) {             // If b was odd, multiply by a and take modulo m
        mul(res, a);
        mod(res, m);
    }
}

// Ensure div2 handles odd numbers correctly
void div2(Bighex a) {
    int carry = 0;
    for (int i = LEN - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        int temp = a[i] + carry * MXW;
        a[i] = temp / 2;
        carry = temp % 2;
    }
}

// Ensure mul handles large numbers correctly
void mul(Bighex a, Bighex b) {
    static Bighex c;
    for (int i = 0; i < LEN; ++i) c[i] = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < LEN; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < LEN - i; ++j) {
            c[i + j] += a[i] * b[j];
        }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < LEN - 1; ++i) {
        c[i + 1] += c[i] / MXW;
        c[i] %= MXW;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < LEN; ++i) a[i] = c[i];
}

// Ensure mod handles large numbers correctly
void mod(Bighex a, Bighex m) {
    static Bighex q, r;
    for (int i = 0; i < LEN; ++i) q[i] = r[i] = 0;

    // Perform division algorithm to find remainder
    for (int i = LEN - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        r[i] = a[i];
        if (greater_or_equal(r, m, 0, LEN, 0)) {
            sub(r, m);
        }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < LEN; ++i) a[i] = r[i];
}
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Odd Check Fix:**
   - Changed `char odd = !is_odd(b);` to `char odd = is_odd(b);` to correctly check if `b` is odd.

2. **Division by 2 Fix:**
   - Modified `div2` to handle the carry properly when dividing by 2, ensuring it works correctly for both even and odd numbers.

3. **Multiplication Fix:**
   - Ensured `mul` handles large numbers correctly by properly carrying over values and updating the result array.

4. **Modulo Operation Fix:**
   - Improved `mod` to perform a proper division algorithm to find the remainder, ensuring the result stays within the bounds of the modulus `m`.

These changes should ensure that the `qpow` function correctly computes \(a^b \mod m\) using modular exponentiation.
